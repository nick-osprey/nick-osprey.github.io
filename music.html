        <h2>Music Projects</h2>
        <p>Other than technology, music is one of my biggest passions. I've been playing guitar since I was 10 years old and play almost everday. I love experimenting with different styles and genres but I mostly prefer a sound that's folkier. Since I was in highschool I've been self publishing my own recordings on sites like Bandcamp under various different names. My two main projects are Nickle Pickle and Blueberry-Lemon, the latter being for older songs I've recorded.</p>

        <p class="description">My latest release 'The Osprey' was written in memory of my Grandmother. The song is about an osprey flying away toward the sunset.</p>

        <p class="description">This song is a more experimental ambient piece which heavily utilies looping and delay effects to create a calm atmosphere.</p>
